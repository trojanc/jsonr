# jsonr â€“ JSON Parsing with Reflection for Go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/trojanc/jsonr.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/trojanc/jsonr)  
A Go library for marshalling to json while maintaining custom types. When JSON is unmarshalled the original types
will be recreated.


Why would you need this? Go's native `json` package does support marshalling back into a struct...yes...but...
As soon as you are using `any/interface{}` the type being used in that field is being lost, and it is impossible
to recreate without explicitly knowing the type when unmarshalling.

For example given the following:

```go
 data := map[string]any {
	"key1": MyStruct{ Name: "John" },
	"key2": OtherStruct { Score: 12},
 }
```
After this data has been marshalled to json, it is impossible to restore it back to a `map[string]any` with arbitrary
structs in it.

This library embeds type information into the JSON, that assists when Unmarshalling to recreate the correct type of
structs.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- **Dynamic JSON parsing** using reflection.
- **Type inference** for automatic struct instantiation.
- **Supports custom types** dynamically.
- **Works with arbitrary and deeply nested JSON**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Requires **Go 1.23+**.

```sh
go get github.com/trojanc/jsonr
```


## Basic Usage

The following example shows how this libary can be used to persist the types maintained in a map supporting any values

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "github.com/trojanc/jsonr"
)

type Person struct {
  Name string
  Age  int
}

type Car struct {
  Make  string
  Model string
}

func main() {
  inputMap := map[string]any{
    "person": Person{Name: "John", Age: 21},
    "car":    Car{Make: "BMW", Model: "X6"},
  }
  data, _ := jsonr.Marshal(inputMap)
  fmt.Println(string(data))
  // {"_t":"map[string]interface","v":{"car":{"_t":"main.Car","v":{"Make":"BMW","Model":"X6"}},"person":{"_t":"main.Person","v":{"Name":"John","Age":21}}}}

  // Unmarshal and register the types that can be contained in the data
  output, _ := jsonr.Unmarshal(data,
    jsonr.RegisterType(Person{}),
    jsonr.RegisterType(Car{}),
  )
  outputMap := output.(map[string]any)
  customer := outputMap["person"].(Person)
  fmt.Printf("person name: %s, age: %d\n", customer.Name, customer.Age)
  // person name: John, age: 21

  car := outputMap["car"].(Car)
  fmt.Printf("car name: %s, age: %s\n", car.Make, car.Model)
  // car name: BMW, age: X6
}
```
